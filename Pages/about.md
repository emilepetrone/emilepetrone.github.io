Sometimes what you think you're getting, and what you get are two wildly different things. That was my experience with Silicon Valley. After starting a company in college, I moved to San Francisco and started down the road I thought I wanted. 10 years later, I had a long list of public accomplishments.

* Sold a website I started
* Invited to the White House
* My work recognized in magazines & blogs like Forbes Small Business, Popular Mechanics, Techcrunch, and more
* Speak at conferences all over the world - in one month alone San Francisco, Detroit, Paris, and Shenzhen
* Work at some of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley- Netflix, Yelp (pre-IPO), Urban Airship, SimpleGeo (acq), and Redbeacon (acq)

However the truth is I wanted off. In January 2018, I sold everything packed what remained in 10 boxes and a backpack, and fled.

You're probably wondering why? Why leave after many interesting twists and turns? To be honest, I was burnt out. I felt like a fraud. I had to pull the rip cord.


Wrong priorities
- money, work, damn everything else
- result was a poor lifestyle - poor relationships, poor health, poor personal life


A life centered on work  
- all of my decisions centered around work - no social life, no dating life, too many dating apps
- do more, learn more, chase more
- after sellign my company, I learned one of my investors would tell his investments that I was the example of the diligence he liked in founders
- honestly, I can't disagree more


Burnt out
- social life, health,
- angry, bitter, no life

- Sell a company, people think you are wildly successful - far from it
- ignorace and arrogance are a lethal cocktail.
- health was terrible - from little sleep, drinking too much to try to sleep, working to try to remedy both
- results were 40 lbs, 2 false alarm heart attacks, and gangreen, peretinities


Fraud
-


Rip cord
- travel, learn, remedy the parts I thought needed a solution


I joined Netflix in 2016, and after a year was told, 'This is not working.' The truth is, I agreed. When I joined Netflix, I was just coming up for air after selling the website I started and beginning to wrap up that process. Everyone on the outside thinks selling a company is this glamorous process. The truth is far from that. Personally it was a mess as my health had deteriorated throughout the life of the business. The combination of ignorance and arrogance created a toxic environment. Twice during the life of my business I went to the doctor only to be told to turn right around and head to the ER. "We cannot tell if you are having a heart attack or not" they said. You should not be getting EKGs in your mid-twenties.
